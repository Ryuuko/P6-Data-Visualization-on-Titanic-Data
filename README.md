# P6-Data-Visualization-on-Titanic-Data
Udacity's Data Analyst Project


* Summary

This project aims at data visualisation of selected dataset. I choose the dataset of Titanic Data from Kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
and its includes variables like the ticket class, sex	and ages of passengers in the famous accident of RMS Titanic On April 15, 1912. This dataset has
11 variables/features in 891 passengers.

* Design

There is a famous rescue principle in the Titanic accident, so called "women and children first", which means they would be the first one to use the lifeboats 
to escape after RMS Titanic hit onto the iceberg and started to sink. This project is going to show if this principle was performed during the accident.
